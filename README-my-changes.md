# Changes made to original script

First things first:

- Goal: clean migration from octopress to hugo
- This is a customized, one-time conversion script.
- The original author demonstrated how to do it.
- I have no knowledge of Go
- so: dirty code ;-)

## Things to ignore

ignore the following:

```text
# command-line-arguments
loadinternal: cannot find runtime/cgo
```

It's only a warning (!?)

## Redirects

The most important feature when migrating blogging engines is that historical URLs are redirected
correctly.

The original script creates a `slug`.

## Output header format: use yaml instead of toml

The default `hugo new` command creates yaml headers, so I'll also use yaml (not toml).

Change it here:

```yaml
// CHANGE HERE: HEADER SYNTAX:
var useHeaderSyntax HeaderSyntax = yaml
```

## Handle alternative category syntax

In octopress one can use different array syntax in the header section.

Option 1:

```yaml
categories:
- foo
- bar
- baz
```

Option 2:

```yaml
categories: [ foo, bar, baz ]
```

The original script handles the first option. This script will also handle the second option.

## Other changes

TODO

## Example data

I am using some real posts from my previous octopress blog. The examples are located in folder
`example-input`.

Example output files are located in folder `example-output`. This folder is excluded from git (via
gitignore).

## Testing the script

```sh
go run octohug.go
```
